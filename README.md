## Qualifying Loans for BizOps

This project is developed for a specific request by the lending software company called BizOps. BizOps wants to make their system more convinient for their customer by giving them the ability to save the qualifying loans to the CSV file so that they can share the results as a spresdsheet.   


## Technologies

I used Python 3.9 on Windows 10 pro.


## How it looks like

When we run the program we will be asked for the path to all the bank data are.

And then we have to follow the prompt to answer all the questions.

And finally after we get the result we will be asked if we want to save the list of qualifying loans. If our reply is yes it will be saved as a CSV file.

Finally we will save the file as we see in the image below.
